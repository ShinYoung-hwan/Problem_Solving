## 문제

- We all have heard the expression “more is better” so, in this problem, we are going to give higher precedence to the letter occurring the most.

- Given a string containing only lowercase letters, you are to sort the letters in the string such that the letter occurring the most appears first, then the letter occurring the second most, etc. If two or more letters occur the same number of times, they should appear in alphabetical order in the output.

## 입력

- The input consists of a single string, appearing on a line by itself, starting in column 1 and not exceeding column 70. The input will contain only lowercase letters (at least one letter).

## 출력

- Print the sorted version of the input string, all on one line with no spaces.
